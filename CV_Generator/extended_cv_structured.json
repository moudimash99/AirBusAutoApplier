    "Systems-minded software & cloud engineer transitioning into Systems Engineering through the ISAE-SUPAERO Mastère Spécialisé® SEN (2025–2026), and an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03). I design and evolve data-intensive, real-time platforms with clear interfaces, measurable SLOs, and strong observability, bridging MBSE thinking (requirements, ICDs, trade-offs, V-model, lifecycle per ISO/IEC 15288) with hands-on delivery across AWS/Kubernetes/Terraform and C++/Python/TypeScript stacks.",
    "My recent work has centered on geospatial/EO pipelines and on-demand tile services: orchestrating ingestion and processing (Airflow, Rasterio/GDAL, STAC), dynamic rendering (Google Earth Engine + FastAPI), and operating them at scale with IaC, GitOps CI/CD, prometheus/grafana dashboards, and defensive caching. I care about latency, cost, and reliability as first-class design variables and routinely translate stakeholder needs into testable requirements, acceptance criteria, and runbooks. Earlier roles in software architecture and AI/CV pipelines sharpened my ability to reason about performance (multithreading, GPU offload), fault modes, and deployment automation across heterogeneous environments (AWS/Azure, containers, microservices).",
    "I thrive where systems architecture meets product reality: decomposing ambiguous problems, making trade studies explicit, specifying interfaces, and then shipping maintainable services with clean code, repeatable deploys, and actionable telemetry. I’m targeting roles in Systems Engineering, Software/Cloud Architecture, or hybrid positions that blend MBSE + real-time data + cloud—especially in aerospace, autonomy, mapping, or other mission-critical domains."
