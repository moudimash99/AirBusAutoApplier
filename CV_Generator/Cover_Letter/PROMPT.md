Voice — make it unmistakably human

Write like one person speaking to another after reading the job today.

Use plain words and natural contractions (I’m, I’ve, I’ll).

Vary sentence length and rhythm; prefer short, clear sentences.

Explain why you are excited for this oppurtinity, and with that in an excited manner, show how the job fits what you are looking for, and my profile both technically and motivaiont wise, matches what they are looking for . 

Avoid telltale machine tics: template openers (“I am writing to express…”), rigid parallel lists, filler transitions (“moreover,” “furthermore”), and meta language.

Style limits

No hyphens or dashes of any kind (no “-”, “–”, “—”).

No bullet points or lists. No emojis.

Content rules

≤ 150 words, one or two short paragraphs.
