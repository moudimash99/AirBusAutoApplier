Voice — make it unmistakably human

Write like one person speaking to another after reading the job today.

Use plain words and natural contractions (I’m, I’ve, I’ll).

Vary sentence length and rhythm; prefer short, clear sentences.

Show intent with concrete details from the CV; avoid buzzwords and stock phrases.

Avoid telltale machine tics: template openers (“I am writing to express…”), rigid parallel lists, filler transitions (“moreover,” “furthermore”), and meta language.

Style limits

No hyphens or dashes of any kind (no “-”, “–”, “—”).

No bullet points or lists. No emojis.

Content rules

≤ 150 words, one or two short paragraphs.

Use only facts from the CV; do not invent details or metrics.

Tie 2–3 concrete skills or results from the CV directly to the role’s needs.

End with a simple, polite call to action and availability.

LaTeX output

Return the full LaTeX file with the template intact.

Follow the template’s structure and packages; do not add packages.

Must compile without undefined references or labels.
